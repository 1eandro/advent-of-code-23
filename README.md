#  ðŸ’» Advent of Code - 2023

## Introduction

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual online event where participants solve daily programming puzzles from December 1st to 25th, akin to an Advent calendar for coders.

I've never done it before. I'm excited to try it this year, let's see how far I'll get!

## How to run them?

To execute the code for a specific challenge, navigate to the root directory and run the following command. Replace `xx` with respective `.py` script. Ensure your Python version is 3.10 or higher.

```sh
python3 xx.py
```

If necessary, substitute `python3` with your specific Python version *(e.g., `python3.13`)*
